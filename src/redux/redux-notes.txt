slices are used in redux 
  slices are created using the method :- createSlice -takes an object with 3 properties
   3 properties -
   1. name
   2. initial state
   3. reducer ( this is exported as default)

redux is used to avoid passing states as props so we create a store that has all the global states
 redux stores are created using method :- configureStore -takes object with reducer property which has an object with all the slices with its name as key
 store is exported as default

provide the store in main.jsx using  <Provider store ={store}> <App /> </Provider>


useSelector( state => state.reducer.initialname)
useDispatch(action())

name
initialstate  ==> createSlice ==>   reducer
reducers                            actions


inside  store-> reducer ==> state
                    ^          |
                    |         `'
outside store-> action <===   ui
